			GENUARY is an artificially generated month of time where we build code that makes beautiful
			things.
			<br />
			GENUARY happens on all the social media sites at once. If you like, you can use hashtags to keep
			track of things: share your work and tag it with #genuary and #genuary2025 and also #genuary1,
			#genuary2, etc, depending on which prompt it is.
